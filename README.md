## Hi there ❤️ 

I'm Paulo! I'm a curious and energetic programmer who enjoys solving problems
and creating valuable solutions. I'm passionate about open source software. I
enjoy spending time with my family, playing racket sports (mostly padel these
days), playing guitar and programming using Elixir.

I've worked with Elixir professionally since 2018 and think it's an incredible
resource for businesses of any size. I'm slowly entering the frontend world
thanks to LiveView and it's been a fantastic experience.

Head over to my <a href="https://pdgonzalez872.github.io" target="_blank">blog</a> for more, I hope you enjoy it!
